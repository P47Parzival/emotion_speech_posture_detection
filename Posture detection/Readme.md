Dataset here used has 4 folders in them which should be stacked into one single folder Silhouettes of human posture to make the pipeline code work.

Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepshah16/silhouettes-of-human-posture

algorithms used here are XGBoost which delivered 59% of accuracy. hence imporvment is required.

Running pipeline code will generate posture_model.pkl which can further be used in app.py or anywhere for further arrangments.
